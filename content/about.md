# About me

I enjoy learning new technologies, and are interested in cybersecurity, web development, system optimization, DevOps, and process automation. I am experienced in full stack web development (custom backend, frontend, and SEO), cybersecurity consulting, penetration testing, red teaming, and project management.

I am also the creator of [LINE Rangers Handbook](https://rangers.lerico.net), an automatically updated reference website renowned among "LINE Rangers" players.
