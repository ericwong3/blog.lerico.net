I enjoy learning new technologies, and are interested in cybersecurity, web development, system optimization, DevOps, and process automation. I am experienced in full stack web development (custom backend, frontend, and SEO), cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity consulting, penetration testing, red teaming, and project management.

I am also the creator of [LINE Rangers Handbook](https://rangers.lerico.net), an automatically updated reference website renowned among "LINE Rangers" players.

Do you have project ideas you want to realize? [Send me an email](mailto:eric@lerico.net) !
