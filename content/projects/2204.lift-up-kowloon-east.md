"Lift Up Kowloon East" is the winning entry to the "City Dress-up Design Competition - Flyover Fantasy Re-Run" competition, and is now the theme for the giant murals designs for the columns under the Kwun Tong Bypass.

The website communiates the murals' design concepts to the public, and a set of 30 AR filters were developed to enhance engagement and create an interactive experience for the visitors.
